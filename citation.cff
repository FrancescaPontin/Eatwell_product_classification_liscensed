  This version of the Eatwell classification tool takes
  product information e.g. (product name, description,
  shelving categories) and uses the developed text matching
  algorithms to assign the food product to a segment of the
  Eatwell Guide. To reflect real-world baskets in addition
  to the five standard segments defined in the Eatwell guide
  products can also be classified as an alcoholic beverage,
  non-alcoholic beverage, discretionary food, composite
  food, baby/toddler foods, other (e.g. spices and
  flavouring) or non-food items (i.e. items that may be
  purchased alongside food items such as kitchen foil, tooth
  paste etc.).
